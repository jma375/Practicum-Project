# Practicum-Project
Scientific Computing Undergraduate Senior Practicum Project


Florida State University, Spring 2021.
Applied machine learning with TensorFlow, in Python, to identify invasive ductal carcinoma in breast histopathology images

Data Set:

Conclusion

For this Practicum project, it was hypothesized that a machine learning model could be trained and tested, using the TensorFlow package, Kaggleâ€™s breast histopathology images, and a machine learning algorithm that I wrote, to identify whether a particular image was positive for invasive ductal carcinoma or was negative for invasive ductal carcinoma. That hypothesis proved to be true. I trained the model and validation error was improved. Once improved, accuracy was assessed at 88.37%.
By completing this project, my computational skills improved because it required me to expand my knowledge and abilities in order to address a scientific problem that interested me. I learned how to (1) build and deploy a machine learning model, (2) utilize the TensorFlow package while working in Python, and (3) manipulate large sets of data. When issues arose, solutions were researched and implemented. Moreover, this project furthered my appreciation for the potential that machine learning represents when it comes to cancer diagnosis. In sum, the skills that I learned and that I honed by completing this Practicum project served to expand my knowledge of and appreciation for machine learning, data science, and computational science.
